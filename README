== Continue coding to base tool
|| 2013-05-07

++ Added ability to load file and began adding parsing logic
== Add logic needed to properly parse/output file

-- Removed residual code that wasn't working
++ Added first stab at parsing by segementing date to: YYYY MM-DD
== Determine how many points are needed per log entry
== Add logic to start outputting JSON of parsed content

++ Added new "functions" to save data being parsed directly into arrays
== Need to complete for loop by determining where you are in the loop 
== Detemine JSON structure for easy output of data to a json file, or D3
++ FOUND BING BOX ERROR! It was /bin/sh vs /bin/bash

++ Added JSON output
++ Created base HTML template, and leveraging to fill needs

:: 2013-05-19
++ Finished code to a 'stable' build
-- Removed sed. Replaced with awk commands
== Make the script recursive functions vs for loops. Ha.
